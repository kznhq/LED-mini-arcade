# Tic-tac-toe-and-Where-s-Waldo-
- Academic project November - December 2023
- Used on PIC24FJ64GA002 Microcontroller and 8x8 Adafruit LED Matrix with C and a little bit of Assembly code.
- This project was with a partner. I worked on the coding and the tic-tac-toe game design for how to translate the rules of the games into coding principles.
