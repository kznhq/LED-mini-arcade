# LED Mini-Arcade
- Academic project November - December 2023
- Used on PIC24FJ64GA002 Microcontroller and 8x8 Adafruit LED Matrix on a breadboard that also had an LCD screen, LED bulb, and multiplexed keypad.
- This project was with a partner. I worked on the coding and the tic-tac-toe game design for how to translate the rules of the games into coding principles.
- Utilized things like C, Assembly, I2C, PWM, and embedded programming.
